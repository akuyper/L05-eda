## Overview

The goal of this lab is to begin to use data visualization and transformation skills to explore data in a systematic way. We call this exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

Additionally, you will learn how to begin exploring missingness in data using the [`naniar` package](https://naniar.njtierney.com/index.html) ðŸ“¦.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L05_EDA.html`. A template is also provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L05.qmd).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
